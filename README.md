**📌 Project Overview**

This project performs a complete end-to-end machine learning and deep learning analysis on the California Health Facility Listing dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, predict facility capacity, classify facility types, and group similar health facilities using unsupervised learning methods.

The project includes:

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Feature Engineering

* Regression Models

* Classification Models

* K-Means Clustering & PCA

* Deep Learning (ANN) for Regression & Classification

* Streamlit App for deployment

* Full ML Lab Report & Documentation



**📊 Dataset Description**

The dataset contains administrative, operational, licensing, and geographical details of healthcare facilities across California.

Key Attributes:

* Facility type and status

* Approval & license dates

* Capacity (target for regression)

* County, district, location details

* Geographic coordinates

* Operational and administrative codes

* Target Variables:

* Regression: CAPACITY

* Classification: Facility category / licensing class

* Clustering: All numeric + encoded features
